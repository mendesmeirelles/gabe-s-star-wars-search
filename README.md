# Gabe's Star Wars
This project is a simple application to implement a web search portal for Star Wars in ReactJS.

It is able to search in categories such as films, people, and planets using SWAPI.

The Search Result is displayed in an infinite scrolling view, and more information can be viewed in a Popup window.

If no matching results is found, a "No Matches" message shall show up. 

To run the app:

1. `npm install`
2.  `npm start` 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

>Gabe Meirelles Star Wars API
